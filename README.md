GitHub has given us 2 special blockquotes for our README's, but they aren't enough and that's why we are offering more options:

## Here are the default ones:

> **Note**: using `> **Note**:`

and

> **Warning**: which is done using `> **Warning**`

But these arent flexible as they have to be used in blockquotes and they can't have words with styling infront of it.
